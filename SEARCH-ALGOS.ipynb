    "# 9. BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH (BFS)\n",
    "# Description: Another algorithm for traversing or searching tree and graph data structures. It starts at the tree root and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n",

    "# Use Case: Ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and for level-order traversal in trees. It's also useful in networking applications like broadcasting.\n",
